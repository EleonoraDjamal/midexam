    <p>
    As for sports, In my elementary years, I learned how to swim due to my medical condition and even took varsity for it. 
    As for middle school, I went for basketball and got into a team. We participated in MIS CUP however didn't get to play 
    in the finals. Highschool, i joined swimming club and once again participated in competitions. In college, i joined 
    the UNKLAB Creative Club for dance.
    <br />
    <br />
    As for musical, i learned how to play the violin from elementary until i was in highschool. I could say i'm pretty 
    good at playing the violin. I also joined the kolintang club for varsity, and end up going for competitions. Our team 
    were awesome to the point we were invited to a competition in Batam. I'm proud we were able to bring back 
    trophies and certificates.
